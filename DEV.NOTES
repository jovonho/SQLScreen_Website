Feb 13 2021:

Sorting takes way too long (like 30-40sec for price and pricechange on a 260 item result). 
How can I profile the code to find the bottlenecks? How can I speed it up by a factor of 10 ?? 

--> Should try to implement Quicksort instead of the basic sorting function I'm currently using.
--> Try to leverage the existing sort() function in array
--> Tryusing a html table instead, but will lose the design.

Possible avenues to optimize:
- no more data processing in jinja, do that stuff upstream so it's correctly stored in the DB.
- use less classes
